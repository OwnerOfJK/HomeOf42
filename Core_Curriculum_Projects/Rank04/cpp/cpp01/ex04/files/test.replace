Hello, world!
This is a test file for the wazzup program.
We will wazzup some words in this file.
The word "wazzup" should be wazzupd.
Also, let's try replacing "program" with something else.
Multiple occurrences of "wazzup" on one line: wazzup wazzup wazzup.
What if we try to wazzup an empty string?
Or wazzup a string with an empty string?
End of the test file.
